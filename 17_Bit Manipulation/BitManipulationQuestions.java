 /*     Question 1: What is the value of x^x for any valueof x?
        Solution 1:The value of x^x = 0. Think about it, xor gives 0 when the bits are the same.
                   If we compare the same number to itself, the bits will always be the same. 
                   So, the answer of x^x will always be 0.

/*      Question 3: Add 1 to an integer using Bit Manipulation.
                    (Hint: try using Bitwise NOT Operator)   
                    
           Solution 3:The expression -~x will add 1 to an integer x.We know that to get negative of a number,
                    invert its bits and add 1 to it(Remember negative numbers are stored in 2â€™s complement form),
                    i.e. 
                    -x = ~x + 1;
                    -~x = x + 1 (by replacing x by ~x)
